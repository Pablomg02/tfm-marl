abstract = {This paper investigates the challenges associated with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) collaborative search and target tracking in dynamic and unknown environments characterized by limited field of view. The primary objective is to explore the unknown environments to locate and track targets effectively. To address this problem, we propose a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method based on Graph Neural Network (GNN). Firstly, a method is introduced for encoding continuous-space multi-UAV problem data into spatial graphs which establish essential relationships among agents, obstacles, and targets. Secondly, a Graph AttenTion network (GAT) model is presented, which focuses exclusively on adjacent nodes, learns attention weights adaptively and allows agents to better process information in dynamic environments. Reward functions are specifically designed to tackle exploration challenges in environments with sparse rewards. By introducing a framework that integrates centralized training and distributed execution, the advancement of models is facilitated. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing MARL method in search rate and tracking performance with less collisions. The experiments show that the proposed method can be extended to applications with a larger number of agents, which provides a potential solution to the challenging problem of multi-UAV autonomous tracking in dynamic unknown environments.}

    abstract = {In recent years, the drone swarm has experienced remarkable growth, finding applications across diverse domains such as agricultural surveying, disaster rescue and logistics delivery. However, the rapid expansion of drone swarm usage underscores the necessity for innovative approaches in the field. Traditional algorithms face challenges in adapting to complex tasks, environmental modeling and computational complexity, highlighting the need for more advanced solutions like multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to enhance efficiency and robustness in drone swarm. Our proposed approach tackles this challenge by embracing temporal and spatial. In terms of the temporal, the proposed approach builds upon historical data, it enhances the predictive capabilities regarding future behaviors. In the spatial, the proposed approach leverage graph theory to model the swarm's features, while attention mechanisms strengthen the relationships between individual drones. The proposed approach addresses the unique characteristics of drone swarms by incorporating temporal dependencies, spatial structures and attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},
